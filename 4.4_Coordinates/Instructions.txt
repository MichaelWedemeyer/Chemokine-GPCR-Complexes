1. Read through the python script "3D_Metrics_Example_Script.py"
2. Change the script to match your file path.
3. Change the residue numbers to match your models conserved resdiues (see text)
4. Open script in Chimera 1.12
	The program will loop through each PDB in the file and calcualte these 3D metrics. The program will close when finished. Note: this is an example script and not optimized for speed, so large numbers of PDBs run at once are not recommended.
